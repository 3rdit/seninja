   "description": "Symbolic execution plugin for BinaryNinja",
   "longdescription": "It is a plugin for BinaryNinja that implements a symbolic execution engine based only on z3, highly inspired by the _angr framework_ (https://angr.io/). \nThe plugin is implemented as an emulator of LLIL instructions that builds and manipulates z3 formulas. \n\nSENinja simulates a debugger: the execution is _path driven_, only one state is _active_ and executes instructions. The other states, generated at branches, are saved in a _deferred queue_. At any time, the active state can be changed with a deferred one. ![](pictures/screenshot.png)",
